# Timber_c-
This repository is referred to a C++ project that I've done during the course C++ Game Programming: Part 1 on Linkedin Learning. 
By using OOP and the power of the integration between C++ and SFML I created a 32-bit application recreating the famous game timber. 
an arcade game that was manufactured by Midway Games in 1984. The object of the game is to amass points by chopping down trees or by balancing on a floating, rotating log.
